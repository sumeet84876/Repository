        "Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and a single independent variable (x) using a straight line. Its purpose is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable, and to quantify the strength and direction of their relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Linearity: The relationship between x and y is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: The residuals (errors) have constant variance across all levels of x.\n",

        "A real-world example is predicting a person's weight (y) based on their height (x). By fitting a simple linear regression, we can estimate how much weight increases for each centimeter increase in height.\n",

        "Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> The least squares method finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. This reduces the overall error of predictions.\n",

        "Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Logistic Regression predicts the probability of a categorical outcome (often binary), using the logistic (sigmoid) function. Linear Regression predicts continuous numeric values using a linear equation. The key difference is the type of outcome they model: Logistic (categorical/probability) vs Linear (continuous).\n",
