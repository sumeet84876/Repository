What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","     => functions is a block of code used to perform specfic tasks functions are reusable. example - print, len, type etc.\n","\n","     METHOD - Method is also block of reusable code called with the object. example - .upper(), .lower(), .append() etc.\n","\n","\n","Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python?\n","\n","      => function argument are actual value of a variable which define when function is called. example - func(1,2,3) - 1,2,3 are argument.   \n","\n","      => parameters are variables which are declared when defining a function. example - def fun(a) -> a is parameter.\n","\n","Q3.

What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","       =>\n","       => ITERABLES =  object which can be looped using for and while loop.\n","           example - a = [1,2,3,\"pwskills\"] # a is iterable.\n","\n","       => ITERATORS = Object that returns items one by one when you call next() on it. example - x = iter(a) convert a into iterator.\n","\n","Q6.

What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?        \n","\n","        => Lambda is anoyomous function also called shorthand function typacally used when we dont need function for long time and without def function. example -x = lambda: x**2\n","                                 x(4)\n","\n","Q9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python?\n","\n","         => usages = Executes a specified function for each of item of an iterable.
