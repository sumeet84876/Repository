Slower but easier to debug.Compiled: Code is converted into machine code by a compiler before execution. Faster but needs recompilation after changes.\n","\n","2. what is Exception handling in Python?\n","\n","  =>Mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully without stopping the program. Uses try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n","\n","3. what is Purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","  =>Code inside finally always runs, whether an exception occurs or not. Often used for cleanup tasks (closing files, releasing resources).\n","\n","4. what Logging in Python?\n","\n","  =>A built-in module (logging) to record events, errors, and other runtime information for debugging or monitoring.\n","\n","5. what is Significance of the __del__ method?\n","\n","  =>Destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed; used for cleanup (but not always reliable for critical cleanup).\n","\n","6. what is Difference between import and from ... import i python?\n","\n","  =>import module → imports the whole module.\n","\n","  =>from module import name → imports specific attributes/functions from the module.\n","\n","7. How can you Handling multiple exceptions?\n","\n","  =>Use multiple except blocks or a single except with a tuple:\n","\n","\n","8. what is Purpose of with statement when handling files in python?\n","\n","  =?Ensures the file is automatically closed after its block ends, even if errors occur.\n","\n"," ex - with open(\"file.txt\") as f:\n","      data = f.read()\n","\n","\n","9. what is Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","  =>Multithreading: Multiple threads share the same memory space, lightweight, good for I/O-bound tasks.\n","\n","  =>Multiprocessing: Multiple processes have separate memory, good for CPU-bound tasks.\n","\n","10. what are Advantages of using logging in program?\n","\n","  =>Keeps records of program execution, helps debug, allows monitoring, can be directed to files/servers.\n","\n","11. what is Memory management in Python?\n","\n","  =>Python uses automatic memory management with a private heap and garbage collector.\n","\n","12. what are Basic steps envolved in exception handling in python?\n","\n","  =>try → Code that may raise an exception.\n","\n","  =>except → Handle the exception.\n","\n","  =>else → Run if no exception occurs.\n","\n","  =>finally → Always runs for cleanup.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management is important in python?\n","\n","  =>Prevents memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures program stability.\n","\n","14. what is Role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","  =>try: Contains risky code.\n","\n","  =>except: Defines how to handle specific errors.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system works?\n","\n","  =>Uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to remove unused objects.\n","\n","16. what is Purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","  =>Runs only if no exception is raised in the try block.\n","\n","17. what are the Common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","  =>DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n","\n","18. what is Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in python?\n","\n","  =>os.fork() (Unix only): Low-level system call to create a new process.\n","\n","  =>multiprocessing: Cross-platform high-level API for process creation.\n","\n","19. what is the Importance of closing a file in python?\n","\n","  =>Frees system resources, ensures data is saved properly.\n","\n","20. what is Difference between file.read() and file.readline()?\n","\n","  =>read() → Reads entire file or given number of characters.\n","\n","  =>readline() → Reads one line at a time.\n","\n","21. what is the Logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","  =>Used for creating logs with timestamps, levels, and messages to track application events.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","  =>Provides functions to interact with the operating system (create, remove, rename files/directories).\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","  =>Cyclic references, memory fragmentation, unpredictable __del__ execution.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","  =>raise ValueError(\"Custom error message\")\n","\n","\n","25.
